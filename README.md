# Chaum-Pedersen Σ-Protocol Implementation in Go

This repository contains an implementation of the Chaum-Pedersen Σ-Protocol in Go. The Chaum-Pedersen Σ-Protocol is a cryptographic protocol that allows a prover to prove possession of a discrete logarithm (e.g., a public key) to a verifier without revealing the actual logarithm.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from the official website: https://golang.org

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone github.com/SmrutiRanjan-Ai/ChaumPedersenSigmaProtocol.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```shell
cd ChaumPedersenSigmaProtocol
```

3. Build and run the application:

```shell
go run main.go
```

## Usage

The main.go file in this repository demonstrates a basic example of the Chaum-Pedersen Σ-Protocol. It includes the steps for both the prover and the verifier.

You can modify the code to suit your specific requirements or integrate it into your own project by importing the relevant functions and types.
